## How Skypier work?

Skypier is a community-based marketplace for listing and rerouting internet traffic through encrypted channels, cultivating a sharing economy by allowing internet access point owners to rent out their unused or underused bandwidth. We have developed a secure communication protocol to ensure a private peer-to-peer (P2P) connection beyond just messages like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. This means it can handle the high throughput requirements of applications such as streaming and gaming. Any internet-connected device can be a peer, e.g., phone, laptop, tablet, IoT devices such as Roomba and Smart TV, etc.


üîê ***Our protocol is serviceable to both Enterprise as well as individuals. For Enterprise services, please see the Enterprise section below.***

There are generally two types of peers in our marketplace: host and client users. A **Host** user is anyone who leases out a portion of their internet bandwidth as a **Node**, and a **Client** user is anyone who subscribes to access the internet through a Host‚Äôs Node. The Host would then earn from the Client's subscription fee. As a marketplace, we connect hosts and clients and facilitate the process of routing the Client‚Äôs internet traffic.
